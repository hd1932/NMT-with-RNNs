# NMT-with-RNNs

Neural machine translation (NMT) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

This NMT system converts a sentence from the source language (e.g. Mandarin Chinese) to the target language (e.g. English). It implements a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) network with attention, and uses a Bidirectional LSTM Encoder and a Unidirectional LSTM Decoder.

Inspired by the https://github.com/pcyin/pytorch_basic_nmt repository.
